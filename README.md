Virtual Terminal - 2.0 PSM
--------------------------

This is the last hidden archive I found of the playstation title of "Virtual Terminal". I have a archive of the last pkg encrypted for the title hidden in a drive that I can't find; but if I do find it; I'll happily add it to the project. 

I'm predicting the Solution files are broken, but that is to be expected.

============================
Compile:

***Attention!***
The solution requires PSM SDK 1.XXX. The solution will NOT compile on PSM SDK 2.XXX.

Unfortunately; you must get your hands on 1.XXX to compile this. I'm not sure if PSM Dev Assistant still works, but you can try. 
============================

USE: 

There is none, the app is useless; but it was fun to work on. Nice experience for debug and gaining user feedback.
